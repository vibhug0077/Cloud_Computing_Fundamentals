# Application Virtualization Overview

## Challenges of application virtualization

Just like any technology, application virtualization isn't the answer for every use case or company need. There can be some challenges, which include:

- **Graphics-intensive apps might be glitchy** -- Latency in these types of applications can cause some stuttering during the rendering process.

- **Device drivers could affect use of peripherals** -- Any application that requires a device driver that is OS-specific could make it difficult to use equipment such as printers or scanners.

- **Dependency on solid network** -- To use a virtualized application, you need access to a reliable internet connection. This can be a challenge for workers who are typically out in remote areas without coverage, etc.

- **Network monitoring software** -- Virtualized apps can cause problems with this software and make it tougher for the system to pinpoint and address and performance issues.

- **Offline access** -- A virtualized app should be accessible offline. If it's not, it won't be as useful to a remote worker who doesn't always have great coverage.

## How does app virtualization differ from traditional application installation?

Before virtualization became possible and widely used across industries, organizations had to install applications manually on every user's device. Twenty or thirty years ago, that might not have been the burden it is today because organizations were using fewer applications. Today, however, the number of applications has exploded and hundreds of millions of applications are developed every year. There's no way an organization would be able to manage and maintain all of their applications today without virtualization and/or cloud-based services.

Local installation and management of applications would be too time-consuming for IT today. The only way an organization can work with so many applications is by virtualizing them and making them available remotely. Application virtualization enables fast, easy delivery of critical applications to practically any endpoint an employee wishes to use. Managing and updating that application is much faster and more streamlined for IT because they only have to manage and update that app once at the host server (not thousands of times on each individual device).

Manually installing software also affects the end user experience. Even if installation is self-service, they need to take the time to download and install the app on their device. And most people have several devices they might want to work from, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Application virtualization makes app access so easy and efficient for end users, with no need to install or download or manage or update.

## Application virtualization vs server virtualization vs desktop virtualization

### Server virtualization

Server virtualization is the most common type of virtualization today. It allows organizations to create multiple virtual machines on a single physical server, which are clustered into groups. This helps IT make the most of the organization's available computing, network, and storage resources and can simplify and streamline recovery if a server malfunctions. It also enables VMs to run previously incompatible operating systems on the same machine without issues.

### Application virtualization

Application virtualization entails making an application available to remote users over a virtualized layer that keeps the application separated from the end user's device OS and hardware. The application is stored on a host server in a datacenter or a third-party hosting company and all actions taken by users in that application are actually executed on the host server. Similar to server virtualization, application virtualization allows users to operate previously incompatible apps on different OSes, such as running Microsoft Excel on Linux via an Opera browser.

### Desktop virtualization

Desktop virtualization entails virtualizing the entire desktop environment, which includes the OS, applications, databases, and other components. Regardless of what device they user, employees will have the same desktop layout and features across all devices because the desktop environment is saved on a host server.

## Using application virtualization software

- **Suitability for today's and future needs** -- Technology is continually evolving and becoming more advanced. You need a virtualization solution that not only meets today's needs but that can also anticipate and support what's coming tomorrow.

- **Flexibility** -- As your organization grows, your application virtualization solution should scale as well. Look for a solution that is secure and scalable enough and that delivers the flexibility that allows you to run workloads on-premises in your datacenter, in the cloud, or on the edge.

- **Compatibility and integration** -- Find a solution that works with your existing infrastructure and integrates with your existing applications as well as back-end systems such as file servers, directory services, and user data stores. The goal is seamless remote access across all users and devices.

- **Technical and after-sales support** -- You're not just purchasing a solution, you're also making a decision to partner with a particular vendor. Make sure that relationship is transparent and that the support team is engaged from the start and committed to your success.

- **Ease of use, deployment, and management** -- Your app virtualization solution should be intuitive and easy to use and manage. It shouldn't require specialized IT skills. It should lighten your IT load and make adoption of certain applications easier!

- **Cost** -- Many factors contribute to total cost of ownership (TCO), but make sure to find a solution that delivers a healthy return on investment (ROI). Be sure to consider hidden cost savings, too, such as the ability to handle bigger workloads with fewer staff, and so on.

- **Security and compliance** -- You want a virtualization system that comes with built-in security features that control and monitor access and usage. Other considerations include end-to-end data encryption, multifactor authentication, and intrusion detection and prevention systems.

- **Licensing** -- Make sure you understand the licensing structure of applications you want to virtualize. You should be permitted to run the app on multiple machines.

## What are some real-world use cases for app virtualization?

There are many common reasons an organization would choose application virtualization over another virtualization strategy, such as VDI. These use cases include:

- **Promotion of BYOD initiatives** -- App virtualization enables employees to use their own devices to access and work within critical business applications.

- **Cost management** -- With virtualized apps, you don't have to provide corporate devices to users, which saves money. You also don't have to provision hardware or provide software for every individual device across the organization. Also, IT burden is reduced, which allows IT teams to accomplish more with fewer people.

- **Application choice** -- Application virtualization provides employees access to all the apps they need to get work done, wherever they are and whatever device they want to use.

- **Avoiding migration issues** -- Employees can use any app on any device, even if their device's OS wasn't originally compatible with the application. There's no need to spend time and effort converting devices to specific OSes.

- **Use of frequently updated internal apps** -- Virtualization makes it easy to update apps as often as desired without having to take the time to update hundreds or thousands of devices. The app can be updated frequently, and every time a user opens the app they'll be accessing the latest version.

- **Secure remote access to sensitive data** -- Because none of the data accesses in an app is stored on the user's device, application virtualization is a great idea for employees that need to access critical apps remotely.

- **Supporting large numbers of employees** -- Any organization with thousands of employees that need access to applications should certainly consider application virtualization. It's the only way to efficiently provide access while keeping management and maintenance streamlined.
