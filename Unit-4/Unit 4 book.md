# Operating System and Virtualization

An **Operating System (OS)** serves as the interface between computer
hardware and users, managing system resources, executing processes, and
providing essential functionalities for applications. With increasing
demand for resource optimization, **virtualization** has become an
integral component of modern operating systems.

**Key Functions of an OS:**

-   **Process Management:** Manages running applications and allocates
    CPU time.

-   **Memory Management:** Allocates and deallocates RAM for processes.

-   **File System Management:** Organizes and controls data storage and
    retrieval.

-   **Device Management:** Controls peripheral devices like printers and
    storage.

-   **Security & Access Control:** Ensures data security and user
    authentication.

# Virtualization

Virtualization refers to the creation of a **virtual version of
computing resources**, including hardware, operating systems, storage,
and networks. It allows multiple virtual environments to operate on a
single physical machine, enhancing efficiency and flexibility.

How Virtualization Works

Virtualization relies on a hypervisor, a software layer that manages
virtual machines (VMs) by allocating system resources such as CPU,
memory, and storage. The hypervisor ensures that each VM operates as an
independent system without interfering with others.

**Together, OS and virtualization enhance system efficiency by enabling
multiple operating systems or applications to run on a single hardware
platform. Virtualization is often integrated into modern OS environments
to support cloud computing, containerization, and virtual machines
(VMs), optimizing performance and reducing infrastructure costs.**

***Diagram: os and virtualization***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/os%20and%20virtualization.png)

# Types of Virtualization:

1.  **Hardware Virtualization** -- Uses a **hypervisor** to run multiple
    virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server, enabling better
    resource utilization.

2.  **Operating System Virtualization** -- Runs multiple OS instances on
    the same machine using **containers** (e.g., Docker, LXC), ensuring
    lightweight and isolated environments.

3.  **Network Virtualization** -- Abstracts physical networking
    components to create **software-defined networks (SDN)** and
    **virtual LANs (VLANs)** for optimized traffic control.

4.  **Storage Virtualization** -- Combines multiple storage devices into
    a single virtualized unit for better management and accessibility.

5.  **Desktop Virtualization** -- Enables users to access their desktop
    environments remotely using **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
    (VDI)**.

***Diagram : virtualization_process***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/virtualization_process.png)

## Components of a Virtual Machine

1.  **Hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor - VMM)**

    -   The hypervisor is the core component that enables
        virtualization. It creates, runs, and manages multiple virtual
        machines on a single physical machine.

    -   It allocates hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and storage
        dynamically among VMs.

    -   Two types of hypervisors exist:

        -   **Type 1 (Bare-metal Hypervisor):** Runs directly on the
            hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM).

        -   **Type 2 (Hosted Hypervisor):** Runs on top of an OS (e.g.,
            VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).

2.  **Guest Operating System**

    -   The OS installed inside a VM, functioning independently of the
        host OS.

    -   Manages applications, processes, and user interactions within
        the virtual environment.

    -   Can be any OS (Windows, Linux, macOS) based on the requirements.

3.  **Virtual CPU (vCPU)**

    -   A software-emulated processor assigned to the VM.

    -   The hypervisor manages and schedules vCPU time across multiple
        VMs using physical CPU cores.

    -   Ensures fair distribution of processing power among running VMs.

4.  **Virtual Memory (vRAM)**

    -   Functions as RAM allocated to the VM from the host system.

    -   The hypervisor dynamically assigns and manages memory to prevent
        over-allocation and ensure performance efficiency.

    -   Uses **memory ballooning** to adjust the amount of memory
        allocated based on demand.

5.  **Virtual Storage**

    -   Virtualized disk space is assigned to each VM using **virtual
        disk images (VDI, VMDK, QCOW2)**.

    -   VMs treat virtual storage as a physical disk, allowing file
        system operations and installations.

    -   Can be dynamically allocated (expands as needed) or fixed-size
        for performance stability.

6.  **Virtual Network Interface (vNIC)**

    -   Allows VMs to connect to networks using virtual network
        adapters.

    -   Supports multiple networking modes:

        -   **Bridged Mode:** VM behaves like a separate physical device
            on the network.

        -   **NAT Mode:** VM shares the host's IP address and
            communicates through it.

        -   **Host-Only Mode:** VMs can only communicate with each other
            and the host machine.

    -   Managed by **virtual switches** that direct traffic between VMs
        and external networks.

7.  **VM Image (Virtual Machine Disk File)**

    -   A pre-configured snapshot containing the guest OS, software, and
        system settings.

    -   Can be copied, cloned, or restored to create new instances of
        the same VM.

    -   Useful for backup, disaster recovery, and fast deployment of
        multiple VMs.

## Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisors

**Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor)**

-   Runs directly on the physical hardware without a host operating
    system.

-   Provides direct access to hardware resources, resulting in better
    performance and lower latency.

-   Commonly used in enterprise data centers and cloud environments.

-   Examples: **VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM, Xen**.

-   **Advantages:**

    -   High efficiency and performance.

    -   Strong security and isolation between VMs.

    -   Suitable for large-scale virtualization.

-   **Disadvantages:**

    -   Requires dedicated hardware.

    -   More complex setup and management.

**Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor)**

-   Runs on top of a traditional operating system (Windows, Linux,
    macOS).

-   Relies on the host OS to access hardware resources, which may
    introduce some performance overhead.

-   Typically used for personal use, software development, and testing.

-   Examples: **Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels
    Desktop**.

-   **Advantages:**

    -   Easy to install and use on existing OS.

    -   Ideal for lightweight virtualization and testing environments.

    -   No need for dedicated hardware.

        hypervisors.

***Diagram Type1 and Type 2***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/Type%201%20and%20Type%202.png)

## Types of Virtual Machines

1.  **System Virtual Machines** -- Provide a full computing environment
    capable of running an OS (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, KVM).

2.  **Process Virtual Machines** -- Run a single application
    independently of the host OS (e.g., Java Virtual Machine (JVM), .NET
    Framework).

## Virtual Machines vs. Physical Machines

    to native execution.

-   **Complexity:** Requires specialized knowledge for setup and
    management.

-   **Resource Contention:** Multiple VMs on a host may compete for
    shared resources.

Virtual Machines are a fundamental part of modern IT infrastructure,
providing a versatile and efficient approach to managing computing
resources in both traditional and cloud environments.

# 

# Cloud Computing vs. Traditional Computing

The way computing resources are managed has evolved from **traditional
on-premise systems** to **cloud-based solutions**. Traditional computing
relies on **physical servers maintained in-house**, requiring
significant infrastructure and IT management. In contrast, **cloud
computing** leverages remote servers hosted by cloud providers, enabling
**scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency**. Each model has its
own benefits and challenges, making it essential to understand their
differences when choosing an IT infrastructure.

**Comparison: Cloud vs. Traditional Computing**
| **Aspect**            | **Cloud Computing**                                   | **Traditional Computing**                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure**    | Uses remote data centers managed by cloud providers. | Requires on-premise servers and dedicated physical hardware. |
| **Cost Model**        | Pay-as-you-go or subscription-based pricing, reducing upfront costs. | High initial investment in hardware and ongoing maintenance costs. |
| **Scalability**       | Easily scales up or down based on demand.           | Limited by physical infrastructure, requiring manual expansion. |
| **Accessibility**     | Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. | Restricted to specific physical locations or private networks. |
| **Maintenance**       | Managed by the cloud provider, reducing IT workload. | Requires an in-house IT team for maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting. |

# Virtual Infrastructure

## What is Virtual Infrastructure?

-   Virtual infrastructure is a software-driven server environment.
    Businesses receive the same power and resources (i.e., storage, CPU
    space, memory, etc.) of a physical hosting environment without the
    maintenance and upkeep since virtual infrastructure is primarily
    delivered via a cloud environment. 

-   An enterprise IT environment is composed of a number of
    software-defined components known as virtual infrastructure.

-   With software, a virtual infrastructure offers the same IT
    capabilities as physical resources, allowing IT professionals to
    swiftly distribute these resources across several systems in
    accordance with the enterprise\'s changing requirements.

-   With a virtual infrastructure, businesses can increase IT resource
    usage, flexibility, scalability, and cost savings by separating
    actual hardware from an operating system.

***Diagram: VI_Architecture***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/VI_Architecture.png)

## Benefits of virtual infrastructure

-   Cost savings: Virtualization lowers capital and operating expenses
    related to factors like electricity, physical security, hosting, and
    server development by combining servers.

-   Scalability: By increasing or decreasing CPU utilization in response
    to shifting market trends and consumer needs, virtual
    infrastructures enable businesses to respond swiftly.

-   Increased productivity: IT teams can react to employee requests for
    new tools and technologies more rapidly when applications and
    resources are provisioned more swiftly.

-   Enhanced Security: Provides better isolation of workloads, reducing
    risks associated with cyber threats.

## Virtual Infrastructure Components

-   Virtualization can distribute computing, memory, storage, and
    networking resources among several virtual machines (VMs) to improve
    application performance, save costs, and simplify maintenance by
    separating operating systems from actual hardware.

-   Despite differences in functionality and design, a virtual
    infrastructure usually includes three essential elements:

    -   Virtual Machines (VM's): Virtual machines are server instances
        that exist within the cloud, providing products like VMware
        hosting. These servers are smaller partitions of a parent
        server. These partitions are created by installing a hypervisor
        layer on the parent server's operating system (OS).

    -   Virtualized Storage:

        -   By consolidating pools of physical storage capacity into a
            single, easier-to-manage repository, this component releases
            enterprises from the limitations and restrictions of
            hardware

        -   Benefits of Virtual Storages:

            -   Easier management: Management occurs via a central
                console, making it easier for small teams to manage data
                and file storage.

            -   Optimization of data: IT departments can move data in a
                virtual storage environment by using software mirroring.
                This makes it possible to transport data with virtually
                little downtime. Data is also more easily accessible to
                end users. They can simply switch to a different virtual
                machine from any endpoint to regain access if they lose
                it.

            -   Improve Network Access: Network disruptions are
                localized to the infected part of your Storage Area
                Network (SAN). In the event of a disruption, you only
                need to take that portion of the network offline. The
                rest of your storage network remains operational.
                Network resources are also readily available for anyone
                with the proper credentials. 

            -   Lower costs: Operating your VSAN costs much less than
                traditional storage because it requires less hardware
                and resources. You can also easily scale your storage
                capacity as your business grows. 

    -   Virtualized Networking and Security:

        -   Users can access network resources from a centralized
            management system thanks to virtualized networking and
            security, which separates networking services from the
            underlying hardware. Important security features, including
            as user provisioning, virtual machine isolation, and
            controlled access, guarantee a safe environment for virtual
            machines.

        -   Three Basic types of Virtual Networks:

            -   VPN: A virtual private network (VPN) connects disparate
                networks over the Internet. Through the VPN, users can
                access these networks from any location.

            -   VLAN: A virtual local area network (VLAN) groups devices
                in domains and makes use of partitions. Every device is
                subject to the resources and configurations of every
                domain.

            -   VXLAN: A virtual extensible local area network (VXLAN)
                builds a third network layer. Network switches can be
                used by organizations to establish endpoints and
                tunnels, allowing access between networks. Data can move
                between these layered endpoints with ease by adding a
                second device, also referred to as a virtual base case.

***Diagram: TypesOfNetworks***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/TypesOfNetworks.jpg)

-   Management Solutions: This part offers an easy-to-use console for
    setting up, maintaining, and allocating virtualized IT
    infrastructure in addition to process automation. In addition to
    providing disaster recovery, backup administration, and high
    availability for applications running in virtual machines, a
    management solution enables IT teams to move virtual machines
    between physical servers without interruptions or delays.


-   **Virtual infrastructure requirements**

    -   Plan Ahead: When designing a virtual infrastructure, IT teams
        should consider how business growth, market fluctuations and
        advancements in technology might impact their hardware
        requirements and reliance on computing, networking and storage
        resources.

    -   Look for ways to cut costs: IT infrastructure costs can become
        unwieldly if IT teams don't take the time to continuously
        examine a virtual infrastructure and its deliverables.
        Cost-cutting initiatives may range from replacing old servers
        and renegotiating vendor agreements to automating time-consuming
        server management tasks.

    -   Prepare for failure: Even the most robust virtual infrastructure
        may encounter outages, even with high availability and failover
        hardware. IT teams should use monitoring tools, buy extra
        hardware, and rely on clusters to better manage host resources
        in order to be ready for the worst-case situation.

***Diagram: Challenges***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/challenges.jpg)

-   **Virtual Infrastructure Architecture**

    -   Organizations can use virtualization to manage and change their
        IT system infrastructure with the use of a virtual
        infrastructure architecture. But in order to produce results,
        the proper building components are needed.

    -   These consist of the following:

        -   HOST: A layer of virtualization that controls virtual
            machine resources and other services. These separate hosts
            serve as the operating systems for virtual machines, which
            carry out ongoing management and monitoring tasks in the
            background.

        -   Hypervisor: A software layer called a hypervisor makes it
            possible for a single host computer to support several
            virtual operating systems, or virtual machines, at the same
            time. The hypervisor extends available resources and
            increases IT flexibility by sharing the same physical
            computing resources, including memory, computation, and
            storage.

        -   Virtual Machines (VM's): Operating systems, software
            applications, and documents are all included in virtual
            machines, which are software-defined computers. Each virtual
            machine is run on a guest operating system, which is managed
            by a virtual infrastructure. The main benefit of virtual
            machines is that, without having to buy hardware, IT teams
            can provision them more quickly and simply than they can
            with real machines.

        -   User Interface (UI): Using a browser-based interface or a
            direct connection to the server host, administrators can
            observe and control virtual infrastructure components thanks
            to this front-end component.

## Key technologies and concepts in virtual infrastructure

-   Virtualization: Virtualization is the process of separating services
    or resources from their physical counterparts. The result is a
    virtual environment with software-controlled resources, operating
    systems, and storage.

-   Desktop Virtualization: It\'s simple to confuse desktop and server
    virtualization when examining these two topics. They are somewhat
    similar in practice in addition to having similar language. There
    are still distinctions, though, and it\'s critical to understand
    them.

-   Server Virtualization: Multiple server instances that can house
    software, processes, and business data are created using server
    virtualization. Desktop virtualization, on the other hand, is
    utilized more privately. Teams can operate remotely from any device
    (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) thanks to this kind of
    virtualization.

-   Software-Defined Networking (SDN):

    -   Computer networking has historically required a lot of
        resources. System administrators must connect computers using a
        variety of physical components, such as switches and routers.
        These limitations are eliminated by software-defined networking
        (SDN), which streamlines the networking procedure.

    -   Even the most complex networking setups can use software-based
        controls in an SDN situation, doing away with the requirement
        for pricey networking hardware. You can still use SDN, though,
        if your company is taking its time making the switch or is
        currently using outdated hardware for any other reason.
        Software-defined networks have the ability to manage
        conventional networking gear in addition to generating virtual
        networks.

    -   By using an SDN to virtualize a network, businesses can avoid
        outgrowing their IT infrastructure and gain a great deal of
        flexibility.


-   Storage Virtualization: Businesses can significantly increase their
    data and processing capacity by pooling several storage arrays
    through the virtualization of storage devices. utilizing virtual
    storage seems to the user to be identical to utilizing a real
    storage device. But behind the scenes, the user has access to almost
    infinite storage capacity because of an abstraction layer.

-   Cloud Computing and Virtual Infrastructure: Cloud computing is based
    on virtual infrastructure. Complex computing tasks that were
    previously limited to large server rooms and data centers can now be
    carried out in the cloud by creating a virtual server environment
    that is distinct from its physical parent.


-   **Use cases and applications of virtual infrastructure**

    -   Data centers and server consolidation

    -   Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI): Virtual desktop
        infrastructure (VDI) allows organizations to virtualize
        individual PCs within their network. Teams can utilize
        virtualization to access their desktop environment from
        anywhere, with any device, making it easy for employees to work
        remotely.

# Cloud Computing Architecture

Architecture of cloud computing is the combination of both SOA (Service
Oriented Architecture) and EDA (Event Driven Architecture). Client
infrastructure, application, service, runtime cloud, storage,
infrastructure, management and security all these are the components of
cloud computing architecture.

The cloud architecture is divided into 2 parts, i.e.

-   Frontend

-   Backend

***Diagram- Viraj Dig3***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/viraj%20Dig%203.jpg)

**1. Frontend**

Frontend of the cloud architecture refers to the client side of cloud
computing system. Means it contains all the user interfaces and
applications which are used by the client to access the cloud computing
services/resources. For example, use of a web browser to access the
cloud platform.

**2. Backend**

Backend refers to the cloud itself which is used by the service
provider. It contains the resources as well as manages the resources and
provides security mechanisms. Along with this, it includes huge storage,
virtual applications, virtual machines, traffic control mechanisms,
deployment models, etc.

**Benefits of Cloud Computing Architecture**

-   Makes overall cloud computing system simpler.

2.  Improves data processing requirements.


3.  Helps in providing high security.


4.  Makes it more modularized.


5.  Results in better disaster recovery.


6.  Gives good user accessibility.


7.  Reduces IT operating costs.


8.  Provides high level reliability.


9.  Scalability

# Cloud Computing Improves Service Management

Cloud computing acts as the backbone of modern service management,
replacing rigid, on-premises systems with dynamic, scalable solutions.
Let's explore how:

**Centralized Control and Simplified Operations**

Traditional IT systems often resemble a tangled web of disconnected
tools. Cloud platforms consolidate these into a single dashboard,
allowing teams to monitor resources, security, and performance in real
time.

Example: A retail company using AWS Management Console can track
inventory, customer data, and sales analytics from one interface,
eliminating silos and reducing human error.

**Scalability: Growing Without the Growing Pains**

Consider a streaming service like Netflix. During peak hours (like a new
show launch), demand skyrockets. With cloud computing, Netflix
automatically scales server capacity to avoid crashes, then scales back
down during quieter periods. This "elasticity" ensures businesses pay
only for what they use, avoiding overinvestment in idle hardware.

**Cost Efficiency: From Capital Expenditure to Operational Flexibility**

Old IT models required upfront investments in servers and licenses,
draining budgets. Cloud operates on a pay-as-you-go model, turning
capital expenditure (CapEx) into operational expenditure (OpEx).

Example: A startup can now launch a global app using Google Cloud for
\$500/month instead of spending \$50,000 on physical servers.

**Automation: Letting Machines Handle the Mundane**

Cloud tools automate repetitive tasks like data backups, software
updates, and security patches.

Example: A bank using Microsoft Azure's AI-driven automation can detect
fraud patterns in, milliseconds, freeing employees to focus on customer
service.

**Disaster Recovery: Safety Nets in the Sky**

When Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, businesses relying on local
servers lost critical data. Cloud platforms store data across global
regions, ensuring redundancy.

Example: A hospital using IBM Cloud's disaster recovery can restore
patient records within minutes, even if local systems fail.

***Figure 1***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/Fig1.jpg)

**A Service-Driven Model: Putting Customers at the Core**

The service-driven model prioritizes delivering value to customers
through agility and innovation. Cloud computing fuels this shift in
three key ways:

**Customer-Centric Design**

Imagine a ride-sharing app like **Uber**. Its success hinges on
real-time updates, GPS tracking, and instant payments---all powered by
the cloud.

*Example:* Uber analyzes user data to tailor promotions (e.g., discounts
for frequent riders) and deploys updates weekly, staying ahead of
competitors.

Agility: Adapting at the Speed of Demand

During the **COVID-1G pandemic**, **Zoom** scaled from **10 million to
300 million** users in months by leveraging cloud infrastructure.
Traditional software would have buckled under this demand, but cloud's
flexibility allowed Zoom to pivot rapidly.

**Collaboration Without Borders**

Cloud tools like **Microsoft Teams** or **Slack** enable global teams to
collaborate seamlessly.

*Example:* A designer in **Tokyo** can edit a prototype on **Figma** (a
cloud-based tool) while a developer in

**Berlin** reviews the code---all in real time.

Case Study: Spotify's Migration to Google Cloud

By shifting to the cloud, **Spotify** reduced latency, personalized
playlists using AI, and cut infrastructure costs by **40%**.

***Figure 2***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/Fig2.jpg)

# Advantages of Cloud: Beyond Cost Savings

While cost reduction is a headline benefit, the cloud's true value lies
in its transformative potential:

**Flexibility: Work from Anywhere, Anytime**

The rise of remote work hinges on cloud accessibility.

Example: A consultant using Salesforce can update client records from a
café in Paris, while a colleague in Sydney reviews the changes
instantly.

**Security: Fortressing Data in the Cloud**

Contrary to myths, cloud providers often offer better security than
on-premises systems.

Example: AWS Shield protects against DDoS attacks, while Azure Active
Directory enforces multi- factor authentication.

**Innovation: Experimentation Without Risk**

Cloud platforms provide sandbox environments for testing ideas.

Example: A gaming company can launch a beta version of a game on Google
Cloud, gather user feedback, and iterate without costly hardware
commitments.

**Sustainability: Greening the Digital Footprint**

Cloud data centers optimize energy use.

Stat: A report by Accenture found that migrating to the cloud can reduce
carbon emissions by 5G million tons annually---equivalent to taking 22
million cars off the road.

# **Pros and Cons of a cloud model**

A cloud model refers to computing resources like storage, servers,
databases, networking, and software hosted on the internet rather than
on local machines. Cloud computing comes in different forms---public,
private, hybrid, and multi-cloud models.\
**Pros:**

-   Cost-effective: Eliminates the need for large upfront investments in
    hardware, allowing businesses to pay only for the resources they
    use, especially beneficial for startups and small
    companies. Pay-as-you-go pricing reduces operational costs.

-   Scalability: Easily scale up or down based on demand without
    infrastructure constraints.

-   Accessibility & Flexibility: Access data and applications from
    anywhere with an internet connection, improving remote work
    capabilities. Choose the service model (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) that best
    suits your needs and adapt to changing requirements.

-   Security & Backup -- Many cloud providers offer robust security
    measures, data encryption, and automated backups.

-   Automatic Updates: Software and security updates are managed by the
    provider, reducing maintenance burdens.

-   Performance & Reliability -- Cloud providers maintain high
    availability with global data centers and redundancy features.

-   Collaboration -- Enables real-time collaboration by allowing
    multiple users to work on shared resources.

**Cons:**

-   Security Concerns: Reliance on third-party providers can raise data
    security issues, requiring careful consideration of data encryption
    and access controls. Storing sensitive data in the cloud may pose
    risks like data breaches and unauthorized access.

-   Vendor Lock-in: Migrating data and applications between cloud
    providers can be complex and costly. Dependence on a single cloud
    provider can make it difficult to switch to another platform without
    significant migration costs.

-   Internet Dependency -- A stable internet connection is required for
    accessing cloud services; outages can disrupt operations.

-   Limited Control -- Users rely on the cloud provider for
    infrastructure management, which can limit customization.

-   Compliance & Legal Issues -- Storing data in different geographical
    regions may lead to compliance challenges (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

-   Latency Issues -- Performance may be affected by network delays,
    especially for real-time applications.

-   Potential Cost Overruns: Unforeseen usage spikes can lead to higher
    than expected cloud bills if not properly managed. 

# Anatomy of Cloud 

The anatomy of cloud computing can be defined as the structure of the
cloud. The anatomy of cloud computing cannot be considered the same as
cloud architecture. It may not include any dependency on which the
technology works, whereas architecture defines and describes the
technology over which it is working. Thus, the anatomy of cloud
computing can be considered a part of the architecture of the cloud.

 Cloud storage architectures include a front end that exposes an API for
accessing storage. This API represents the Small Computer Systems
Interface (SCSI) protocol in traditional storage systems; however, these
protocols are changing in the cloud. This could be an internal protocol
for implementing specific features or a standard back end for physical
discs.

The storage logic is a layer of middleware that sits behind the
frontend. Over typical data-placement techniques, this layer
incorporates a range of characteristics, such as replication and data
reduction, over the traditional data-placement algorithms. Finally, the
backend implements data storage on a physical level.

# Cloud Components

1\. Client Infrastructure

Client infrastructure is a significant part of the frontend system that
offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for seamless cloud
communication. 

2\. Application

It can either be a piece of software or a platform. The application
delivers the outcome to the user along with the resources in the back
end, depending on the client's needs. 

3\. Service

Based on the client's needs, a cloud computing architecture service
controls the type of service you can access. Cloud architecture
computing provides three types of services, including: Software as a
Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a
Service (IaaS).

4\. Runtime Cloud

Virtual machines can access a runtime and execution environment via the
runtime cloud.

5\. Storage

Storage is yet another crucial element of cloud computing architecture.
It offers a sizable quantity of cloud storage space for managing and
storing data. 

6\. Infrastructure

Cloud architecture offers network-level, application-level, and
host-level services. To support the concept of cloud computing
architecture, cloud infrastructure comes with software and hardware
elements, including storage, virtualization software network devices,
and other storage resources. 

7\. Management

This component oversees the management of backend components such as
storage infrastructure, runtime clouds, storage applications, and other
security-related issues. Also, it promotes coordination among them.

8\. Security

Security is a core component of a backend cloud architecture. It offers
users secure access to cloud architecture, resources, information, and
systems. Also, it leverages virtual firewalls to deploy security
management services to the cloud server. This aids in data loss
prevention. 

9\. Internet

A backend and frontend can interact and communicate with one another
thanks to an internet connection, which serves as a mediator or bridge
between them.

# Delivery Models of Cloud

There are three main cloud service delivery models:

-   Software as a Service (SaaS)

-   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

-   Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**

SaaS is the most well-known of the three cloud service delivery models.
That's because most people use SaaS applications every day, whether they
know it or not.

The SaaS delivery model enables users to utilize fully functional
software that is operated and managed in the cloud. Typically, users
access SaaS applications through a web browser. The key advantage to
this is the elimination of concerns related to downloading and
installing programs, as these tasks are handled by the vendor. However,
depending on the specific service, you may need to download a plugin.

Key benefits of SaaS include:

It's lightweight: Running SaaS applications typically doesn't require as
many computing resources as on-prem software.

No need for software updates: Vendors manages and update SaaS
applications. That means everyone has access to the most up-to-date
version at all times.

No more software licensing: Premium SaaS applications follow a
subscription-based model, removing the need for purchasing and renewing
software licenses. This model is particularly popular among businesses
with remote workers, as it enables access to powerful business tools
without the need for hardware upgrades or manual software updates.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

Traditionally, a company's IT infrastructure was hosted on-premises,
requiring organizations to make continual investments in hardware and
maintain regular updates to keep systems current.

With technological advancements, organizations have increasingly turned
to cloud service providers to simplify the management of their IT
infrastructure. This shift led to the emergence of Infrastructure as a
Service (IaaS), prompting organizations to migrate from on-prem to
cloud-based infrastructure. IaaS empowers businesses by providing access
to virtualized computing resources hosted on cloud servers, with
benefits including:

Greater flexibility: IaaS lets you access infrastructure services on
demand. Additionally, you can scale infrastructure to support business
growth and reduce it when needed.

Cost savings: You don't have to buy physical hardware every time you
want to upgrade. Since your computing infrastructure is provided on a
subscription basis, the responsibility for managing the infrastructure
falls to your vendor.

Reliability: Your assets are stored in a remote data center, where it's
managed by cloud service providers. This service model all but
eliminates the threat of a single point of failure.

IaaS eradicates the necessity for in-house hardware, allowing
organizations to access cutting-edge IT infrastructure at a
significantly reduced cost. This renders IaaS an increasingly favored
service model, particularly among small and medium-sized companies. By
eliminating the need for substantial hardware investments, IaaS
facilitates a more equitable competitive landscape, enabling smaller
enterprises to rival larger organizations with more extensive budgets.
Additionally, the flexibility to scale infrastructure on demand further
enhances the appeal of IaaS for businesses of varying sizes.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

This cloud computing service delivery model is commonly referred to as a
solution stack. It empowers organizations to develop, execute, and
oversee cloud-based software without the necessity for onsite
infrastructure. These platforms are supplied and maintained by a
third-party vendor, relieving businesses of concerns related to tasks
such as backups and server provisioning---all of which are handled on
their behalf. PaaS benefits include:

Improved efficiency: Since a third party handles your IT infrastructure
needs, businesses can spend more time focusing on developing, testing,
and deploying applications.

Simplicity: PaaS gives businesses a platform with development tools, so
they can develop, test, and host applications in the same environment.

Better collaboration: PaaS requires teams to develop over the internet,
eliminating the need to transfer files and manually sync data. Everyone
works with the same up-to-date information all the time.

# Service Request Management (SRM): Your Cloud Ordering System

Imagine you\'re working for a company that uses the cloud. You need a
virtual machine (a computer in the cloud) to test a new software
application. You can\'t just install it on any random computer -- you
need a specific type of virtual machine with certain software and
security settings. This is where SRM comes in. It\'s the organized way
you ask for and get what you need from the cloud.

Think of it like ordering food online. You wouldn\'t call the restaurant
and just tell them to \"bring something.\" You\'d browse the menu,
choose a specific dish, maybe add some sides, and then place your order.
SRM is similar:

-   **The Service Catalog: The Cloud\'s Menu:** This is a central list
    of *all* the cloud services your company offers. It\'s like the
    restaurant\'s menu, but instead of food, it lists things like:

    -   **Virtual Machines:** Different types of virtual computers with
        varying amounts of processing power, memory, and storage. Maybe
        you need a Windows virtual machine or a Linux virtual machine.
        Maybe you need one with a lot of memory for running complex
        simulations.

    -   **Storage:** Space to store your files and data. You might need
        a small amount of storage for documents or a massive amount for
        databases.

    -   **Software Applications:** Access to cloud-based software, like
        a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system or a project
        management tool.

    -   **Databases:** Cloud-based databases to store and manage
        information.

    -   **Networking:** Connectivity resources, like setting up virtual
        networks or firewalls.

-   **Making a Request: Placing Your Order:** Just like ordering food,
    you use a website or app (called a *service portal*) to browse the
    service catalog. You find the virtual machine you need, select it,
    and specify the details:

    -   **Type of Virtual Machine:** The operating system (Windows,
        Linux, etc.), the amount of RAM, the storage size.

    -   **Software Needed:** Any specific software that needs to be
        pre-installed on the virtual machine.

    -   **Security Requirements:** Specific security settings or access
        controls.

    -   **Duration:** How long you need the virtual machine for (a few
        hours, a few days, or ongoing).

-   **Approvals (Sometimes): Getting the Boss\'s OK:** In many
    organizations, your request needs to be approved. This is like
    asking your manager for budget approval or your parents for
    permission to borrow the car. It ensures that cloud resources are
    used wisely and that costs are controlled. The approval process
    might involve your manager, the IT department, or a dedicated cloud
    governance team.

-   **Behind the Scenes: From Order to Delivery:** Once your request is
    approved, the magic happens. The request is sent to the
    *provisioning system* (or team). This system automatically sets up
    the virtual machine according to your specifications. It\'s like the
    restaurant kitchen preparing your meal. The provisioning system
    allocates the necessary hardware resources, installs the software,
    configures the network settings, and makes the virtual machine
    available to you.

-   **Tracking and Management:** SRM also helps track your requests and
    the resources you\'ve been allocated. You can see the status of your
    request, how much it\'s costing, and how long you\'ve been using the
    resources.

***Diagram Csrm process***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/Csrm%20process.png)

**Why is SRM so important?**

-   **Organization:** It brings order to the chaos of cloud resource
    requests. Without it, everyone would be asking for resources in
    different ways, leading to confusion and inefficiency.

-   **Control:** It allows organizations to control how cloud resources
    are used and prevent runaway costs. Approvals ensure that resources
    are allocated responsibly.

-   **Efficiency:** It automates the request and provisioning process,
    speeding up access to cloud services. You don\'t have to wait days
    or weeks for someone to manually set up a virtual machine.

-   **Tracking:** It provides a clear audit trail of who requested what,
    when, and for how long. This is essential for billing, cost
    analysis, and security.

-   **Self-Service:** It empowers users to request resources themselves,
    without having to go through IT every time. This frees up IT staff
    to focus on more strategic tasks.

So, SRM is the key to smoothly and effectively accessing and managing
cloud resources within an organization. It\'s the bridge between what
you need and how you get it in the cloud.

#  Provisioning: The Cloud\'s Construction Crew

Imagine you\'ve placed your order for a virtual machine (VM) through the
Service Request Management (SRM) system. Now, the cloud needs to *build*
that VM for you. That\'s what provisioning is all about. It\'s the
process of setting up all the necessary components so you can actually
use the cloud resources you requested. Think of it as the construction
crew coming in after you\'ve gotten the building permit. They lay the
foundation, build the walls, and install the plumbing and electricity.

Provisioning takes your approved request and turns it into reality.
It\'s not just about getting *a* VM; it\'s about getting the *right* VM,
configured exactly how you need it.

**The Provisioning Process: What Happens Behind the Scenes?**

Provisioning involves several key steps:

1.  **Resource Allocation:** The provisioning system identifies the
    available resources in the cloud data center. This includes finding
    a physical server with enough capacity to host your VM, determining
    the available storage space, and allocating network bandwidth. It\'s
    like the construction crew finding the right plot of land and
    gathering the necessary building materials.

2.  **Virtualization (Often):** In most cloud environments, VMs are
    created using virtualization technology. This means that multiple
    VMs can run on a single physical server. The provisioning system
    creates a virtual layer on top of the physical hardware, allowing
    your VM to operate independently. It\'s like dividing a large office
    building into smaller individual offices.

3.  **Operating System Installation:** The chosen operating system (like
    Windows or Linux) is installed on your VM. This is like installing
    the plumbing and electrical systems in your office.

4.  **Software Installation and Configuration:** Any required software
    applications or tools are installed and configured on the VM. This
    is like furnishing your office with desks, chairs, and computers.

5.  **Network Configuration:** The VM is connected to the network,
    allowing it to communicate with other resources and the internet.
    This is like connecting your office to the internet and phone lines.

6.  **Security Setup:** Security measures, such as firewalls and access
    controls, are configured to protect your VM and data. This is like
    installing security cameras and locks on your office doors.

7.  **Access Granting:** You are given the necessary credentials
    (username and password) to access your VM. This is like getting the
    key to your office.

**Types of Provisioning: How You Get Your Resources**

There are two main ways provisioning can happen:

-   **Automated Provisioning: The Robot Chef:** This is the most common
    type of provisioning in the cloud. Software tools automatically
    handle the entire process. Once your request is approved, the system
    takes over, allocating resources, installing software, and
    configuring everything without any human intervention. It\'s like a
    restaurant using automated cooking systems to prepare food after you
    place your order. Automated provisioning is fast, efficient, and
    scalable.

-   **Self-Service Provisioning: The Vending Machine:** Some cloud
    providers offer self-service provisioning portals. These portals
    allow you to directly provision resources yourself. You can select
    the type of VM you need, choose the operating system, and configure
    the settings, all through a web interface. It\'s like using a
    vending machine to get a snack. You select what you want, and it\'s
    dispensed immediately. Self-service provisioning gives you more
    control and flexibility, but it requires some technical knowledge.

**Why is Provisioning so Important?**

-   **Access to Resources:** Provisioning is the essential step that
    gives you access to the cloud resources you need. Without it, your
    requests would just sit there, unfulfilled.

-   **Speed and Efficiency:** Automated provisioning is incredibly fast.
    You can get a new VM up and running in minutes, rather than the days
    or weeks it might take in a traditional data center.

-   **Scalability:** Provisioning allows the cloud to scale dynamically.
    If demand for resources increases, the cloud provider can quickly
    provision more resources to meet that demand.

-   **Flexibility:** Provisioning allows you to easily change your
    resource allocation. If you need more storage or more processing
    power, you can simply provision additional resources.

In short, provisioning is the process that makes the cloud truly dynamic
and on-demand. It\'s the engine that turns your requests into working
cloud resources.

[]{#_Toc191575475 .anchor}Optimized Infrastructure: The Well-Oiled Cloud
Machine

Imagine a city. If the roads are poorly planned, you\'ll have traffic
jams. If the power grid is unreliable, you\'ll have blackouts. A
well-functioning city requires careful planning and management of its
infrastructure. The same is true for the cloud. Optimized infrastructure
is like city planning for the cloud. It\'s all about making sure
everything runs smoothly, efficiently, and securely. It\'s about getting
the most out of your cloud resources without wasting money or
sacrificing performance.

**Key Strategies for Cloud Infrastructure Optimization:**

-   **Right-Sizing: Finding the Goldilocks Zone:** Right-sizing is all
    about using the *right* amount of resources -- not too much, not too
    little. It\'s like choosing the right size truck for a delivery. If
    you\'re delivering a small package, you don\'t need a huge
    semi-truck; a van will do. Similarly, in the cloud, if your
    application doesn\'t require a lot of processing power or memory,
    you don\'t need a massive virtual machine. Right-sizing involves
    analyzing your application\'s needs and choosing the appropriate
    resources (CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth) to meet those
    needs efficiently. This avoids paying for resources you don\'t use.

-   **Auto-Scaling: Adapting to the Flow:** Sometimes, the demand for
    your cloud resources fluctuates. Think of a website that gets a lot
    more traffic during a sale or a popular event. Auto-scaling allows
    your cloud infrastructure to automatically adjust to these changes
    in demand. It\'s like a highway that automatically adds more lanes
    during rush hour and then reduces them when traffic subsides.
    Auto-scaling monitors resource usage and automatically scales up
    (adds more resources) when demand increases and scales down (reduces
    resources) when demand decreases. This ensures that your application
    can handle traffic spikes without crashing and that you\'re not
    paying for idle resources during quiet periods.

-   **Load Balancing: Sharing the Load:** Imagine a store with only one
    checkout line. Everyone would be waiting in a long queue! Load
    balancing solves this problem in the cloud. It distributes incoming
    traffic across multiple servers or resources. It\'s like having
    multiple checkout lines in a store. If one server becomes
    overloaded, the load balancer redirects traffic to other servers,
    ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed and that your
    application remains responsive.

-   **Caching: Speeding Things Up:** Caching is like having small local
    warehouses for popular products. Instead of going all the way to the
    main warehouse every time someone wants a product, you can get it
    from the local warehouse much faster. In the cloud, caching stores
    frequently accessed data closer to users. This reduces latency (the
    time it takes for data to travel) and improves application
    performance. When a user requests data, the system first checks the
    cache. If the data is in the cache, it\'s served immediately. If
    not, the data is retrieved from the main storage and then added to
    the cache for future use.

-   **Monitoring and Analytics: Keeping an Eye on Things:** Just like a
    city needs traffic cameras and weather reports to manage its
    infrastructure, cloud infrastructure needs monitoring and analytics.
    Monitoring tools track various metrics, such as CPU usage, memory
    consumption, network traffic, and application performance. Analytics
    tools analyze this data to identify trends, bottlenecks, and
    potential problems. This information is crucial for optimizing
    infrastructure, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that
    everything is running smoothly.

**Why is Optimized Infrastructure so Important?**

-   **Cost Savings:** By right-sizing resources and using auto-scaling,
    you can significantly reduce your cloud spending. You\'re not paying
    for resources you don\'t need.

-   **Improved Performance:** Load balancing and caching improve
    application responsiveness and reduce latency, leading to a better
    user experience.

-   **Increased Reliability:** Auto-scaling and load balancing make your
    cloud infrastructure more resilient and fault-tolerant. If one
    server fails, others can take over, ensuring that your application
    remains available.

-   **Enhanced Security:** Optimized infrastructure also includes
    implementing security best practices, such as firewalls, intrusion
    detection systems, and access controls, to protect your cloud
    environment.

-   **Scalability and Agility:** Optimized infrastructure enables your
    cloud environment to scale quickly and easily to meet changing
    business needs.

In essence, optimized infrastructure is the key to getting the most out
of your cloud investment. It\'s about making your cloud environment
efficient, performant, reliable, and secure. It\'s the foundation for a
successful cloud strategy.

# The Client-Server Model: The Cloud\'s Conversation

The client-server model is the fundamental way computers talk to each
other, not just in the cloud, but across the internet and in many other
network environments. It\'s the basic structure behind how you access
websites, use email, and stream videos. Think of it as a restaurant: you
(the client) order food from the waiter (the server). The waiter takes
your order to the kitchen (the server\'s domain), where the food is
prepared, and then brings it back to you.

[]{#_Toc191575477 .anchor}The Three Key Players:

-   **Client: The Asker:** The client is the entity that *requests* a
    service or resource. This could be:

    -   **Your Computer:** When you browse a website, your computer acts
        as the client, requesting web pages from a web server.

    -   **Your Smartphone:** When you use a mobile app, your phone is
        the client, requesting data and services from a cloud server.

    -   **A Web Browser:** The browser you use to access the internet
        (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) is a type of client software.

    -   **A Mobile App:** Apps on your phone or tablet are clients that
        communicate with servers to provide their functionality.

    -   **Another Computer or Program:** Even other computers or
        programs can act as clients, requesting services from servers.

-   **Server: The Provider:** The server is the entity that *provides*
    the requested service or resource. It\'s a powerful computer (or a
    virtual machine in the cloud) that stores data, runs applications,
    and responds to client requests. Servers can be specialized:

    -   **Web Servers:** These servers store and deliver web pages to
        clients.

    -   **Mail Servers:** These servers handle email, storing and
        sending messages.

    -   **Database Servers:** These servers store and manage data for
        applications.

    -   **Game Servers:** These servers host online games, allowing
        players to connect and interact.

    -   **Cloud Servers:** These are the servers that make up the cloud
        infrastructure, providing various services like virtual
        machines, storage, and databases.

-   **Network: The Messenger:** The network is the communication channel
    between the client and the server. It\'s how the client\'s requests
    reach the server and how the server\'s responses get back to the
    client. This could be:

    -   **The Internet:** The global network connecting millions of
        computers and devices.

    -   **A Local Network (LAN):** A network connecting computers within
        a limited area, like a home or office.

    -   **A Wireless Network (Wi-Fi):** A network that uses radio waves
        to connect devices wirelessly.

[]{#_Toc191575478 .anchor}How the Client-Server Interaction Works:

1.  **Request:** The client initiates the interaction by sending a
    *request* to the server. This request specifies what service or
    resource the client needs. For example, when you type a website
    address into your browser, your browser (the client) sends a request
    to the web server for that website\'s web page.

2.  **Processing:** The server receives the request and processes it. It
    might retrieve data from a database, run a program, or perform some
    other action to fulfill the request. The web server, upon receiving
    your request, retrieves the requested web page from its storage.

3.  **Response:** The server sends a *response* back to the client. This
    response contains the requested data or the results of the server\'s
    processing. The web server sends the requested web page back to your
    browser.

4.  **Display:** The client receives the response and displays it to the
    user. Your browser displays the received web page.

[]{#_Toc191575479 .anchor}The Client-Server Model in the Cloud:

In the cloud, the client-server model is essential. When you use a cloud
service, your device (the client) connects to a cloud provider\'s
servers. These servers host the applications and data that you access.
The cloud provider manages the servers and infrastructure, while you
(the client) interact with the services through your device.

##  Why is the Client-Server Model so Important?

-   **Centralized Management:** Servers can be centrally managed, making
    it easier to update, maintain, and secure applications and data.

-   **Resource Sharing:** Multiple clients can access the same server
    and share its resources, making it more efficient and
    cost-effective.

-   **Scalability:** Servers can be scaled to handle increasing numbers
    of clients and requests.

-   **Specialization:** Servers can be specialized to perform specific
    tasks, such as web serving, database management, or email handling.

-   **Foundation of Cloud Computing:** The client-server model is the
    fundamental architecture that enables cloud computing. It\'s how we
    access and use cloud-based services.

The client-server model is the backbone of how we interact with the
digital world, and it\'s especially crucial in the cloud era. It\'s the
conversation that makes the cloud work.

# Chargeback

In cloud computing , chargeback refers to the practice In cloud
computing, chargeback refers to the practice of attributing the costs of
cloud services back to the business units, departments, or projects that
use them. It is a way of ensuring that the costs of cloud resources are
borne by the parts of the organization that actually use them, promoting
accountability and cost awareness.

These models are essential for organizations that have adopted a shared
cloud infrastructure, as they provide transparency into the consumption
of cloud resources and help in budgeting and optimizing cloud costs over
time.

Organizations on AWS use tools like Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and Cost
and Usage Reports to create a detailed itemization of cloud expenses
across departments and projects. There are also a variety of custom
scripts and third-party tools available to help automate and streamline
the data collection and resource optimization process.

# What's Different About Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing differs from traditional computing in several ways:

Cloud computing represents a paradigm shift from traditional computing
models, offering distinct differences that have been extensively
analyzed in academic literature.

**1. Resource Provisioning and Elasticity**

Traditional computing environments often require significant upfront
investments in hardware and infrastructure, leading to fixed resource
capacities. In contrast, cloud computing provides on-demand resource
provisioning, allowing users to scale resources dynamically based on
workload requirements. This elasticity enables efficient handling of
varying workloads without the need for substantial capital expenditure.

**2. Cost Structure**

The financial models of traditional and cloud computing differ markedly.
Traditional computing involves capital expenditures for infrastructure,
with ongoing operational costs for maintenance and upgrades. Cloud
computing, however, adopts a pay-as-you-go model, converting capital
expenses into operational expenses. This shift allows organizations to
pay only for the resources they consume, potentially leading to cost
savings and more predictable budgeting .

**3. Accessibility and Collaboration**

Traditional computing resources are typically confined to specific
physical locations, limiting remote access and collaboration. Cloud
computing leverages internet connectivity to provide ubiquitous access
to data and applications, facilitating real-time collaboration across
geographically dispersed teams. This accessibility enhances productivity
and supports modern, flexible work environments.

**4. Maintenance and Management**

In traditional computing setups, organizations are responsible for the
maintenance, updates, and security of their infrastructure,
necessitating dedicated IT personnel and resources. Cloud computing
shifts these responsibilities to service providers, who manage
infrastructure maintenance, software updates, and security measures.
This transition allows organizations to focus more on their core
competencies rather than IT management.

**5. Security Considerations**

Security paradigms differ between traditional and cloud computing.
Traditional computing offers direct control over data and
infrastructure, which some organizations prefer for sensitive
information. Cloud computing, while offering advanced security measures,
requires trust in third-party providers. Concerns about data privacy,
compliance, and potential exposure to vulnerabilities necessitate
careful evaluation of cloud service agreements and security practices.

Cloud computing and grid computing are two distinct paradigms in the
realm of distributed computing, each offering unique benefits.

# Benefits of Cloud Computing

1.  **Cost Savings**: Cloud computing eliminates the need for
    significant upfront capital investments in hardware and
    infrastructure. Organizations can access computing resources on a
    pay-as-you-go basis, reducing operational costs.

2.  **Scalability**: Cloud services offer on-demand scalability,
    allowing businesses to adjust resources dynamically based on
    workload requirements without the need for physical hardware
    changes.

3.  **Security**: Cloud providers implement robust security measures,
    including data encryption and regular updates, to protect sensitive
    information. This enhances data security compared to traditional
    on-premises systems.

4.  **Flexibility and Mobility**: Cloud computing enables access to
    applications and data from any location with internet connectivity,
    facilitating remote work and collaboration across geographically
    dispersed teams.

5.  **Disaster Recovery and Loss Prevention**: Cloud-based backup
    solutions provide efficient disaster recovery options, ensuring data
    is not lost due to unforeseen events.

# Grid Computing

-   **What is Grid Computing**

One type of distributed computing architecture is grid computing. Grid
computing allows resources to be used in cooperative ways and does not
charge users for their use.

> ***Diagram :Adv_gridComputing***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/adv_gridComputing.jpg)

# Cloud computing vs Grid Computing

-   Two distributed computing models are cloud computing and grid
    computing. They have various architectures and serve diverse
    functions. Instead of using local servers to store, manage, and
    process data, cloud computing uses distant servers. Grid computing,
    on the other hand, is a network of computers that collaborate to
    complete a task that would be challenging for a single machine.

-   Cloud Computing is a Client-server computing architecture. In cloud
    computing, data and programs are stored and accessed on distant
    servers hosted online rather than on a local server or the
    computer\'s hard drive.

# Benefits of Grid Computing

1.  **Resource Sharing**: Grid computing allows for the pooling of
    computational resources from multiple locations to work on a single
    task, maximizing resource utilization and efficiency.

2.  **Cost-Effective Scalability**: By leveraging existing hardware
    across a network, grid computing provides a cost-effective way to
    achieve high computational power without significant additional
    investment.

3.  **Enhanced Performance**: The distributed nature of grid computing
    enables parallel processing of complex computations, leading to
    faster task completion and improved performance.

4.  **Flexibility**: Grid computing systems can easily integrate diverse
    hardware and software resources, providing flexibility to adapt to
    various computational needs.

5.  **Collaboration**: Grid computing facilitates collaboration among
    organizations by allowing them to share resources and work together
    on large-scale projects, fostering innovation and knowledge sharing.

# Clusters

Cluster computing is a collection of tightly or loosely connected
computers that work together so that they act as a single entity. The
connected computers execute operations all together thus creating the
idea of a single system.

***Diagram :Viraj DIG 4***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/viraj%20Dig%204.jpg)

**Classification of Cluster:**\
 

**1. Open Cluster:**

IPs are needed by every node and those are accessed only through the
internet or web. This type of cluster causes enhanced security concerns.

**2. Close Cluster:**

The nodes are hidden behind the gateway node, and they provide increased
protection. They need fewer IP addresses and are good for computational
tasks. 

# Clusters and Clouds

-   Cluster Computing: Limited to a specific network where the cluster
    is deployed.

# Utility Computing

Utility computing is a model of **cloud computing** where computing
resources---such as processing power, storage, and networking---are
provided to users **on demand** and billed based on usage, similar to a
utility service like electricity or water. This model enables businesses
to scale their IT infrastructure dynamically, paying only for the
resources they consume instead of investing in and maintaining expensive
hardware and software.

In a **utility computing environment**, cloud providers (such as AWS,
Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure) manage the underlying infrastructure,
allowing organizations to focus on their core business operations. This
model enhances cost efficiency, flexibility, and scalability while
reducing the need for large upfront capital expenditures.

However, utility computing also comes with challenges, such as **data
security concerns, vendor lock-in, and potential performance
fluctuations** due to shared resources. Despite these risks, utility
computing remains a fundamental component of modern cloud services,
supporting applications across industries like healthcare, finance, and
e-commerce.

# Evolution of Cloud Computing 

The phrase "Cloud Computing" was first introduced in the 1950s to
describe internet-related services, and it evolved from distributed
computing to the modern technology known as cloud computing.

1\. Distributed Computing (1950s)

The foundation of cloud computing began with distributed computing,
where multiple computers worked together to share resources and process
data. This allowed computational tasks to be distributed across
different systems, improving efficiency and performance.

2\. Mainframe Computing (1960s-1970s)

Mainframe computing introduced large centralized systems that processed
data while users accessed them through terminals. These systems provided
robust processing power but lacked the scalability and flexibility of
modern cloud computing.

3\. Cluster Computing (1980s-1990s)

Cluster computing emerged as a solution to enhance performance by
connecting multiple computers to function as a single system. This
approach improved processing capabilities and fault tolerance, making
computing more reliable.

4\. Grid Computing (1990s-2000s)

Unlike cluster computing, which is usually confined to a single network,
grid computing distributed resources across multiple locations. This
enabled organizations to share computing power on a large scale, making
complex computations more accessible.

5\. Virtualization (2000s)

Virtualization revolutionized computing by enabling multiple operating
systems and applications to run on a single physical machine. This
abstraction of hardware resources increased efficiency, optimized
resource utilization, and laid the foundation for cloud computing.

6\. Web 2.0 (Early 2000s)

The rise of Web 2.0 brought user-driven applications and interactive web
services. Websites became more dynamic, promoting real-time
collaboration and online service platforms, which increased the demand
for scalable and distributed computing resources.

7\. Service Orientation (Mid-2000s)

With the increasing need for efficient software architectures,
service-oriented computing emerged. This approach focused on delivering
computing functionalities as modular, reusable services, forming the
backbone of cloud-based applications.

8\. Utility Computing (Mid-2000s)

Utility computing introduced the concept of providing computing
resources as a pay-per-use service, similar to utilities like
electricity and water. This allowed businesses to scale resources
dynamically based on demand, reducing costs and infrastructure
management efforts.

9\. Cloud Computing (2007+)

Cloud computing integrated all previous advancements into a
comprehensive model. It offers on-demand access to computing power,
storage, and applications over the internet. With models like
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and
Software as a Service (SaaS), cloud computing has transformed how
businesses and individuals use technology, enabling scalability,
cost-efficiency, and flexibility.

***Diagram:Evolution of cloud***
![Benefits of cloud computing](/images/diagrams/Evolution%20of%20cloud.png)

# Cloud Computing Milestones

-   1960s -- Concept of Utility Computing: John McCarthy proposed the
    idea that computing could be sold as a utility like electricity or
    water. This concept laid the foundation for cloud computing.

-   1990s -- Rise of Virtualization and Grid Computing: With
    advancements in virtualization, multiple operating systems could run
    on a single machine. Grid computing allowed distributed computing
    across multiple locations, making resource sharing more efficient.

-   1999 -- Birth of SaaS with Salesforce: Salesforce launched a
    customer relationship management (CRM) platform delivered entirely
    over the internet, marking the beginning of Software as a Service
    (SaaS).

-   2002 -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) Launched: Amazon introduced AWS,
    providing cloud-based computing services, storage, and other tools
    for businesses.

-   2006 -- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) by AWS: AWS introduced EC2,
    allowing businesses to rent computing power on a flexible,
    pay-as-you-go model. This was a major shift towards modern
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

-   2007 -- Emergence of Cloud Computing: The term "cloud computing"
    gained popularity as companies started offering scalable, on-demand
    computing resources over the internet.

-   2008 -- Google App Engine Launched: Google introduced App Engine,
    enabling developers to build and deploy applications on Google's
    infrastructure, marking the growth of Platform as a Service (PaaS).

-   2010 -- Microsoft Azure Enters the Market: Microsoft launched Azure,
    expanding cloud services with enterprise-level computing, storage,
    and AI capabilities.

-   2011 -- Introduction of OpenStack: OpenStack, an open-source cloud
    computing platform, was introduced, allowing businesses to build
    private and public cloud solutions.

-   2014 -- Rise of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Strategies: Organizations
    began adopting hybrid clouds (a mix of private and public cloud
    solutions) and multi-cloud strategies (using multiple cloud
    providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud).

-   2018 -- Growth of AI and Serverless Computing: Cloud providers
    started integrating AI and machine learning tools into cloud
    services. Serverless computing, which allows developers to run code
    without managing infrastructure, became widely adopted.

-   2020s -- Edge Computing and Cloud-Native Applications: With the rise
    of IoT (Internet of Things), edge computing became popular, allowing
    data processing closer to devices rather than centralized cloud
    servers. Businesses also increasingly adopted cloud-native
    applications built using containers and Kubernetes.
