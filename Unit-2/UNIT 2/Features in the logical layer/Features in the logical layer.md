**Features in the logical layer**

**1. Increased Security –** 

The ability to control the execution of a guest program in a completely transparent manner opens new possibilities for delivering a secure, controlled execution environment. All the operations of the guest programs are generally performed against the virtual machine, which then translates and applies them to the host programs. 
A virtual machine manager can control and filter the activity of the guest programs, thus preventing some harmful operations from being performed. Resources exposed by the host can then be hidden or simply protected from the guest. Increased security is a requirement when dealing with untrusted code. 
**Example-1:** Untrusted code can be analyzed in Cuckoo sandboxes environment. 
The term sandbox identifies an isolated execution environment where instructions can be filtered and blocked before being translated and executed in the real execution environment. 
**Example-2:** The expression sandboxed version of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) refers to a particular configuration of the JVM where, by means of security policy, instructions that are considered potentially harmful can be blocked. 

**2. Managed Execution –** 

In particular, sharing, aggregation, emulation, and isolation are the most relevant features. 

` `**3. Sharing –** 

Virtualization allows the creation of a separate computing environment within the same host. This basic feature is used to reduce the number of active servers and limit power consumption. 

**4. Aggregation –** 

It is possible to share physical resources among several guests, but virtualization also allows aggregation, which is the opposite process. A group of separate hosts can be tied together and represented to guests as a single virtual host. This functionality is implemented with cluster management software, which harnesses the physical resources of a homogeneous group of machines and represents them as a single resource. 

**5. Emulation –** 

Guest programs are executed within an environment that is controlled by the virtualization layer, which ultimately is a program. Also, a completely different environment with respect to the host can be emulated, thus allowing the execution of guest programs requiring specific characteristics that are not present in the physical host. 

**6. Isolation –** 

Virtualization allows providing guests—whether they are operating systems, applications, or other entities—with a completely separate environment, in which they are executed. The guest program performs its activity by interacting with an abstraction layer, which provides access to the underlying resources. The virtual machine can filter the activity of the guest and prevent harmful operations against the host. 

Besides these characteristics, another important capability enabled by virtualization is performance tuning. This feature is a reality at present, given the considerable advances in hardware and software supporting virtualization. It becomes easier to control the performance of the guest by finely tuning the properties of the resources exposed through the virtual environment. This capability provides a means to effectively implement a quality-of-service (QoS) infrastructure. 

**7. Portability –** 

The concept of portability applies in different ways according to the specific type of virtualization considered.
In the case of a hardware virtualization solution, the guest is packaged into a virtual image that, in most cases, can be safely moved and executed on top of different virtual machines. 
In the case of programming-level virtualization, as implemented by the JVM or the .NET runtime, the binary code representing application components (jars or assemblies) can run without any recompilation on any implementation of the corresponding virtual machine. 

**8.Resource sharing:**

Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to share the resources of a single physical machine, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. This improves hardware utilization and reduces the need for additional physical servers.

**9.Flexibility:** 

Virtualization allows IT administrators to quickly and easily create, modify, or delete virtual machines as needed, without the need to purchase and configure additional physical hardware.

**11.Hardware independence:** 

Virtual machines are hardware-independent, which means they can run on different types of physical hardware and can be easily moved between physical servers without needing to reconfigure the virtual machine.

**12.Scalability:**

` `Virtualization allows organizations to scale their computing resources up or down as needed, depending on changing business requirements.

**13.Management:** 

Virtualization provides centralized management tools that allow IT administrators to monitor and manage multiple virtual machines from a single console, making it easier to troubleshoot and maintain the virtualized environment.

virtualization provides a powerful and flexible technology that can help organizations maximize their hardware utilization, improve their IT infrastructure scalability, and simplify their IT management.

**14.Disaster Recovery:**

Virtualization enables organizations to implement disaster recovery solutions more easily and cost-effectively. By replicating virtual machines to remote sites, organizations can quickly recover from a disaster and resume operations.

**15.Testing and Development:**

Virtualization allows organizations to easily create test and development environments without the need for additional physical hardware. This enables developers to test new applications and configurations in a controlled environment before deploying them to production.

**16.Energy Efficiency:**

Virtualization can help organizations reduce their energy consumption by consolidating multiple physical servers onto a single machine. This can result in lower electricity bills and a reduced carbon footprint.

**17.Increased Uptime:**

Virtualization can help improve system uptime by enabling virtual machines to be migrated to different physical hosts in the event of a hardware failure. This can minimize downtime and prevent data loss.

**18.Cost Savings:**

Virtualization can help organizations save money by reducing the need for additional physical hardware, lowering electricity bills, and streamlining IT operations. This can result in significant cost savings over time.

**19.Improved Security Management:**

Virtualization can help organizations improve their security posture by isolating applications and workloads from each other. This can prevent security breaches from spreading to other parts of the environment and reduce the attack surface.

**20.Cloud Migration:**

Virtualization can be a stepping stone for organizations looking to migrate to the cloud. By virtualizing their existing infrastructure, organizations can make it easier to move workloads to the cloud and take advantage of cloud-based services.


**What is Storage Virtualization?**

Storage virtualization is functional RAID levels and controllers are made desirable, which is an important component of storage servers. Applications and operating systems on the device can directly access the discs for writing. Local storage is configured by the controllers in RAID groups, and the operating system sees the storage based on the configuration. The controller, however, is in charge of figuring out how to write or retrieve the data that the operating system requests because the storage is abstracted.

**Types of Storage Virtualization**
![](images/Types%20of%20Storage%20Virtualization.png)
**1. Kernel-Level Virtualization**

**Definition:**

Kernel-level virtualization is a method where a modified **Linux kernel** functions as a hypervisor, allowing multiple virtual servers to run on a single physical host. It does not require specialized hardware virtualization extensions.

**How It Works:**

- A **host OS runs a specialized kernel module** that creates isolated virtual environments (containers).
- Each virtual environment shares the same kernel but operates independently.
- Example: **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)** is a popular kernel-level virtualization technology in Linux.

**Key Features:**

\- Lower overhead than hypervisor-based virtualization.
\- Fast performance due to direct access to the hardware.
\- Containers run with near-native speed.

**Use Cases:**

- **Web hosting environments** – Used in cloud platforms like **Docker** and **LXC (Linux Containers)** for lightweight virtualization.
- **Enterprise servers** – Companies use kernel virtualization for running multiple server instances efficiently.

**Examples:**

- **Linux KVM** – Turns Linux into a hypervisor that supports multiple virtual machines.
- ` `**Docker & LXC** – Container-based technologies using kernel-level virtualization.

**2. Hypervisor-Based Virtualization**

**Definition:**

A **hypervisor** (also called a **Virtual Machine Monitor, or VMM**) is a software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run on the same physical hardware. It is the foundation of traditional **hardware virtualization**.

**Types of Hypervisors:**

Hypervisors can be classified into two types:

\- **Type 1 (Bare-Metal) Hypervisor** – Runs directly on the host hardware without an underlying OS.

- Example: **VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen**.
- Use Case: Used in **enterprise data centers** for server consolidation.

\- **Type 2 (Hosted) Hypervisor** – Runs on top of an existing OS.

- Example: **VMware Workstation, VirtualBox**.
- Use Case: Used for **software testing** and personal virtualization setups.

**3. Hybrid Virtualization (Part of Hypervisor-Based Virtualization)**

**Definition:**

Hybrid virtualization is a combination of **full virtualization** (which allows unmodified OSes to run on a hypervisor) and **para-virtualization** (which requires OS modifications but improves efficiency).

**How It Works:**

- The hypervisor supports **both fully virtualized and para-virtualized guests**.
- Uses **hardware-assisted virtualization (Intel VT-x, AMD-V)** for full virtualization.
- Allows **para-virtualized drivers** to improve performance by bypassing full hardware emulation.

**Key Features:**

\- **Flexibility** – Can run both **modified and unmodified guest OSes**.
\- **Performance Optimization** – Uses **hardware acceleration** for full virtualization while applying **direct hypervisor communication** for para-virtualized guests.
\- **Reduced Overhead** – Hybrid virtualization optimizes **I/O operations** and **CPU cycles**, reducing resource usage.

**Use Cases:**

\- **Cloud Service Providers** – Used in platforms like **AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure**.
\- **Enterprise Data Centers** – Businesses that require **high-performance and scalable virtual environments**.
\- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** – Used for AI workloads, simulations, and scientific computing.

**Examples:**

\- **Xen Hybrid Virtualization** – Supports both **fully virtualized and para-virtualized guests**.
\- **KVM with VirtIO Drivers** – Uses **hardware-assisted virtualization** but improves I/O performance using **para-virtualized drivers (VirtIO)**.

**4. Hardware-Assisted Virtualization**

**Definition:**

Hardware-assisted virtualization enhances **full virtualization** using specialized CPU extensions like **Intel VT-x and AMD-V**.

**How It Works:**

- The CPU provides **direct support for virtualization**, reducing hypervisor overhead.
- Memory management features like **Extended Page Tables (EPT)** improve performance.

**Key Features:**

\- Improved performance for fully virtualized guests.
\- Reduces **hypervisor complexity**.
\- Direct **hardware access** speeds up I/O operations.

**Use Cases:**

\- **Enterprise IT infrastructure** – Used in **VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V**.

- ` `**KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)** – Uses Intel VT-x for faster VM execution.

**5. Para-Virtualization**

**Definition:**

Para-virtualization requires **guest OS modifications** to work with the hypervisor more efficiently. Unlike full virtualization, it **reduces emulation overhead** by allowing **direct hypervisor communication**.

**How It Works:**

- The guest OS is aware that it’s running in a virtualized environment.
- Certain privileged instructions are **replaced with hypercalls**, improving performance.

**Key Features:**

\- Faster than full virtualization due to reduced **emulation overhead**.
\- Direct **guest-to-hypervisor** communication.
\- Lower CPU and memory footprint.

**Use Cases:**

\- **Cloud computing platforms** – Used in **AWS EC2 Xen instances** for performance optimization.
\- **High-performance applications** – Used in **networking and storage virtualization**.

**Examples:**

- **Xen Hypervisor** – Supports para-virtualization to enhance VM performance.
- ` `**VMware Tools & VirtIO Drivers** – Para-virtualization components that optimize I/O operations.

**Methods of Storage Virtualization**

- **Network-based storage virtualization:** The most popular type of virtualization used by businesses is network-based storage virtualization. All of the storage devices in an FC or iSCSI SAN are connected to a network device, such as a smart switch or specially designed server, which displays the network's storage as a single virtual pool.
- **Host-based storage virtualization:** Host-based storage virtualization is software-based and most often seen in HCI systems and cloud storage. In this type of virtualization, the host, or a hyper-converged system made up of multiple hosts, presents virtual drives of varying capacity to the guest machines, whether they are VMs in an enterprise environment, physical servers or computers accessing file shares or cloud storage.
- **Array-based storage virtualization:** Storage using arrays The most popular use of virtualization is when a storage array serves as the main storage controller and is equipped with virtualization software. This allows the array to share storage resources with other arrays and present various physical storage types that can be used as storage tiers.

**How Storage Virtualization Works?**

- Physical storage hardware is replicated in a virtual volume during storage virtualization.
- A single server is utilized to aggregate several physical discs into a grouping that creates a basic virtual storage system.
- Operating systems and programs can access and use the storage because a virtualization layer separates the physical discs from the virtual volume.
- The physical discs are separated into objects called logical volumes (LV), logical unit numbers (LUNs), or RAID groups, which are collections of tiny data blocks. 
- RAID arrays can serve as virtual storage in a more complex setting. many physical drives simulate a single storage device that copies data to several discs in the background while stripping it. 
- The virtualization program has to take an extra step in order to access data from the physical discs. 
- Block-level and file-level storage environments can both be used to create virtual storage.

**Advantages of Storage Virtualization**

Below are some Advantages of Storage Virtualization.

- Advanced features like redundancy, replication, and disaster recovery are all possible with the storage devices.
- It enables everyone to establish their own company prospects.
- Data is kept in more practical places that are farther from the particular host. Not always is the data compromised in the event of a host failure.
- IT operations may now provision, divide, and secure storage in a more flexible way by abstracting the storage layer.

**Disadvantages of Storage Virtualization**

Below are some Disadvantages of Storage Virtualization.

- Storage Virtualization still has limitations which must be considered.
- Data security is still a problem. Virtual environments can draw new types of cyberattacks, despite the fact that some may contend that virtual computers and servers are more secure than physical ones.
- The deployment of storage virtualization is not always easy. There aren't many technological obstacles, including scalability.
- Your data's end-to-end perspective is broken by virtualization. Integrating the virtualized storage solution with current tools and systems is a requirement.

In Storage Virtualization we have learned about how this offered considerable economic and operational savings over "bare metal" storage, but is now mostly overshadowed by the cloud paradigm . By using virtualized storage, enterprises were able to improve storage systems' security and speed while also lowering compatibility issues.

**Host-Level Storage Virtualization**
![](images/Host-Level%20Storage%20Virtualization.png)
**Definition:**

Host-level storage virtualization is a technique where the storage abstraction is managed at the **host level**, meaning the operating system or a dedicated software layer on the host aggregates multiple physical storage devices into a single logical storage unit. This allows the OS to manage storage efficiently without requiring a dedicated external storage controller or network-based virtualization.

**How It Works:**

- The **host OS or software** virtualizes multiple physical storage devices.
- The system presents a **single logical storage pool** to applications and users.
- It allows dynamic storage allocation, redundancy, and performance 

**Key Features:**

\- **Software-Defined Storage (SDS)** – No specialized hardware needed; handled entirely by software.
\- **Logical Volume Management (LVM)** – Allows flexible partitioning and resizing of storage volumes.
\- **RAID Support** – Can include built-in **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)** for data redundancy and performance.
\- **Improved Performance** – Balances storage loads efficiently.

**Use Cases:**

\- **Enterprise IT Infrastructure** – Businesses use host-level virtualization to manage large disk arrays effectively.
\- **Cloud and Virtual Machines (VMs)** – Cloud-based services leverage host-level virtualization for dynamic storage management.
\- **Database Servers** – Large-scale databases like **MySQL, PostgreSQL** use host-level storage virtualization for performance improvements.

**Examples:**

- **Logical Volume Manager (LVM) in Linux** – Manages storage at the OS level by aggregating multiple drives into logical volumes.
- **Windows Storage Spaces** – Allows users to combine multiple drives into a single storage pool with redundancy.
- **VMware vSAN** – Uses host-based storage virtualization for distributed storage across multiple physical servers.
